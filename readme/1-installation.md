## Step 1 - Installation

The fastest way to get started is to use the CLI. Run the following two commands to setup your project from scratch. If you choose to use the CLI you can skip the reset of the steps in this readme.

```node
> npm i {{ ids.npm }} -g
> web-config new --dir="my-project"
```

To use it in your project you can install it like this.

```node
> npm i {{ ids.npm }} --D
```
