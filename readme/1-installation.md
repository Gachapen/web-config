## Step 1 - Installation

The fastest way to get started is to use the CLI. Run the following command to setup your project from scratch. If you choose to use the CLI you can skip the rest of the steps in this README file.

```node
$ npm init web-config new <dir>
```

To use it in your project you can install it like this.

```node
$ npm i {{ ids.npm }} --D
```
