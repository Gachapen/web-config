## Step 1 - Installation

The fastest way to get started is to use the cli. Run the following two commands to setup your project from scratch.

```node
> npm i {{ ids.npm }} -g
> web-config new --dir="my-project"
```

To use it in your project you can install it like this.

```node
> npm i {{ ids.npm }} --D
```
